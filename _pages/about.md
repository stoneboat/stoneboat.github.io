My name is Wei, Yu (卫煜). I am a PhD student in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, studying cryptography under the supervision of Professor [Vassilis Zikas](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vassilis-zikas). Before transferring to Georgia Tech, I pursued my PhD at Purdue University. Prior to that, I earned a Master's degree in Computer Science, a Bachelor's degree in Engineering, and a Bachelor's degree in Law from Nankai University in China. Regarding work, my passion is to help people benefit from vast potential of data while protect the privacy of those who contribute it. I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of machine learning, cryptography, and privacy.

My recent research focuses on developing generic tools for differential privacy analysis, with a central question: <strong>How to compute the privacy profile of an arbitrary randomized algorithm that meets minimal assumptions?</strong> I approach this question through various lens, aiming to build an easy-to-use privacy analysis toolkit for domain experts -- those who know well how to extract valuable insights from data but may not be familiar with the intricacies of proving privacy guarantees. Beyond this, there are a lots of particular theoretical/pratical questions I want to explore, for details please feel free to reach out and discuss with me! 


I am also fortunate to work with researchers in various fields, including secure computation, machine learning, symmetric key cryptography, and game theory. It is a real pleasure for me to learn from and exchange ideas at any intersection of privacy and various disciplines. If you are interested in working with me, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am eager to exchange ideas and welcome your input :smile: .
