I am very happy my work about Pseudo-Equilibria was accpeted at Science of Blockchain Conference 2025!

In this work, we design a notion of pseudo-equilibrium that enables the incorporation of cryptographic primitives into mechanism design, bridging the assumption gap between traditional game theory and cryptography. I was first introduced to this topic three years ago in Professor Alexandros Psomas's game theory course, where my collaborator Athina and I proposed the initial idea as part of my final project and was fortunate to receive an A+ for the work. Reasoning across the boundaries of two fields is never easy, and I’m grateful for the consistent efforts of my collaborator Athina, as well as my advisors Professor Vassilis Zikas and Professor Psomas. After much iteration, we’ve converged on a compelling formulation. I’m excited to see how it resonates with the broader community!
