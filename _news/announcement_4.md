I spent this summer as a visiting researcher at UMD, and I want to give a huge thanks to Professor Katz for being an amazing host! Next up, I'll be heading to Georgia Tech to continue my PhD journey with Professor Zikas. I'm super grateful for everything that's happened so far and can't wait to see what the future holds!
