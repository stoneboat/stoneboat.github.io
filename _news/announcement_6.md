I'm excited to share that I’ve joined JPMorgan Chase as an AI Research Associate Intern this summer, working under the mentorship of Antigoni Polychroniadou. During the internship, I designed a new noise distribution that achieves higher accuracy than standard Gaussian noise in high-dimensional query settings. The new mechanism is also compatible with advanced matrix factorization techniques, enabling the addition of correlated noise to further improve accuracy. I am also glad to contribute to several other differential privacy–related projects.
